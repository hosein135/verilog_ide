//! Program-block initial statements run through the same executor as module
//! initials — so blocking task/method calls suspend and resume correctly.
//!
//! IEEE 1800.1-2023 §24 (`program` blocks): a `program` block's `initial`
//! processes are scheduled in the *reactive* region. xezim drains them from
//! `pending_reactive`. Previously `drain_reactive_region` ran each statement
//! through the bare `exec_statement` loop, which has no blocking-task inlining
//! and no method `this`-binding. A `program` initial that called a task whose
//! body blocked (`#delay`/`@event`/`wait`) ran that body SYNCHRONOUSLY — the
//! blocking control was not honoured, the caller's continuation ran at t=0,
//! and (for the genuine UVM path) `this` came back null.
//!
//! The fix routes the queued statements through `run_process_stmts` with a
//! fresh pid — exactly the executor module initials use — so a `program top`
//! behaves like a `module top`. These regressions pin that:
//!
//!   1. A bare-name blocking task (with a `wait` body) called from a program
//!      initial SUSPENDS until the condition holds, then runs its
//!      continuation (pre-fix: the `wait` was ignored, continuation ran at t0).
//!   2. A `#delay` task body suspends the program initial, advancing time
//!      before the continuation.
